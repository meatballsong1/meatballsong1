    <h3><b>LuaU and JavaScript Programmer</b></h3>
</div>

## Introduction
I’m oofbomb, a LuaU programmer with roughly 3–6 years of experience on the Roblox platform, currently expanding into JavaScript and Python. I'm also a beginner cybersecurity analyst. Currently, my main focus is on game development and scripting. Additionally, I’m learning more about IT and cybersecurity to build a stronger foundation in both fields. I am also in the process of learning TypeScript, which I think will prove useful in my day-to-day tasks.

### Open Source Projects
Hopefully in the future, I’ll have the motivation to release some useful open source projects for the community. For now, all of my projects are private.

## Contact
You can reach me via Discord: `@oofbomb` (`1160424627521212417`)

## Portfolio
Currently, my domain portfolio is inactive but should be up soon (as of 6/19/2025). I’ll update this with the domain once it’s live.
My **public** github page is quite bare, and **does not** serve as my portfolio.
*(Sorry i thought the bold looked cool)*
